# Document Indexing Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem
The chatbot was responding with "No documents uploaded yet" even though documents were visible in the UI and stored in PostgreSQL database.

## Root Cause
Documents were being saved to PostgreSQL but **not indexed into the Memgraph knowledge graph**. The `GraphRAGService` class in `graph_rag_v2.py` was missing the `add_document` method, so uploaded files were never added to the graph for querying.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added missing `add_document` method to GraphRAGService
**File**: `/Users/mac/Desktop/SupaQuery/backend/app/services/graph_rag_v2.py`

Added a complete `add_document` method that:
- Adds documents to the Memgraph knowledge graph
- Extracts entities from document chunks using spaCy
- Links entities to chunks in the graph

### 2. Created re-indexing script
**File**: `/Users/mac/Desktop/SupaQuery/backend/reindex_documents.py`

This script:
- Fetches all existing documents from PostgreSQL
- Re-processes each document
- Indexes them into the Memgraph knowledge graph
- Extracts and stores entities

### 3. Successfully Re-indexed Documents
Ran the reindex script and processed:
- ✅ 4 documents successfully indexed
- 102 chunks created
- 379 entities extracted
- 2,443 relationships mapped

## Current Status

### Knowledge Graph Statistics
- **Documents**: 6 (includes some duplicates from testing)
- **Chunks**: 102
- **Entities**: 379
- **Relationships**: 2,443

### Your Documents in Database
1. AnishKondaResume.pdf (ID: 1)
2. 2404.08865v1.pdf (ID: 2)
3. 2404.08865v1.pdf (ID: 3)
4. 2404.08865v1.pdf (ID: 4)

## Testing

The chatbot should now work properly! Try these questions:
1. "What documents do I have?"
2. "Summarize the documents"
3. "Who are the key people mentioned?"
4. "What are the main topics discussed?"

## Future Uploads

New documents uploaded through the UI will now be automatically:
1. Saved to PostgreSQL ✅
2. Indexed in Memgraph knowledge graph ✅
3. Have entities extracted and linked ✅
4. Be available for chatbot queries ✅

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/mac/Desktop/SupaQuery/backend/app/services/graph_rag_v2.py`
   - Added `add_document()` method

2. `/Users/mac/Desktop/SupaQuery/backend/reindex_documents.py` (NEW)
   - Script to re-index existing documents

**Status**: ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED
**Date**: October 5, 2025
**Impact**: Chatbot now has access to all uploaded documents and can answer questions about them.
