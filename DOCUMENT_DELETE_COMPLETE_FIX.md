# Document Delete Complete Fix

## Issue
When attempting to delete a document, the error occurred:
```
'EnhancedGraphRAGService' object has no attribute 'delete_document'
```

Additionally, the deletion was not removing physical files from the uploads directory, only removing entries from the knowledge graph database.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `delete_document` Method to All GraphRAG Services

Updated the following service files to include the complete `delete_document` method:
- `backend/app/services/graph_rag_enhanced.py`
- `backend/app/services/graph_rag.py`
- `backend/app/services/graph_rag_clean.py`
- `backend/app/services/graph_rag_v2.py`

### 2. Complete Deletion Implementation

The `delete_document` method now handles:

#### a) Knowledge Graph Deletion
- Removes document nodes from Memgraph
- Removes associated chunk nodes
- Removes entity relationships
- Removes all graph connections

#### b) Physical File Deletion
- Deletes the actual file from the `uploads/` directory
- Handles cases where file may already be deleted
- Provides appropriate logging for each step

### 3. Method Signature

```python
async def delete_document(self, document_id: str, file_path: Optional[str] = None) -> None:
    """
    Delete a document from the knowledge graph and optionally delete the physical file
    
    Args:
        document_id: The ID of the document to delete
        file_path: Optional path to the physical file to delete
    """
```

### 4. Updated API Endpoint

Modified `backend/main.py` to:
1. Retrieve document info before deletion (to get file path)
2. Delete from database (cascades to chunks)
3. Pass file path to GraphRAG service for complete cleanup

```python
@app.delete("/api/documents/{document_id}")
async def delete_document(document_id: int, current_user: User = Depends(require_documents_delete)):
    # Get document info before deletion
    document = await db_service.get_document(document_id, current_user.id)
    file_path = document.file_path
    
    # Delete from database
    success = await db_service.delete_document(document_id, current_user.id)
    
    # Remove from GraphRAG and delete physical file
    await graph_rag_service.delete_document(str(document_id), file_path=file_path)
```

## What Gets Deleted

When a document is deleted, the system now removes:

1. ✅ **Database Records**
   - Document entry
   - All associated chunks (CASCADE)
   - Document shares (CASCADE)

2. ✅ **Knowledge Graph (Memgraph)**
   - Document node
   - Chunk nodes
   - Entity nodes linked to this document
   - All relationships

3. ✅ **Physical Files**
   - Original uploaded file from `uploads/` directory

## Logging

The implementation provides detailed logging:
- `✅ Deleted document {id} from knowledge graph`
- `✅ Deleted physical file: {path}`
- `⚠️  File not found (may have been already deleted): {path}`
- `❌ Error deleting file {path}: {error}`

## Testing

To test the complete deletion:

1. Upload a document
2. Note the document ID and check that the file exists in `uploads/`
3. Delete the document via the API
4. Verify:
   - Document is removed from database
   - Document is removed from knowledge graph
   - Physical file is deleted from `uploads/`

## Benefits

- **Complete Cleanup**: No orphaned files or data
- **Storage Management**: Frees up disk space
- **Data Consistency**: All references removed
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases
- **Logging**: Clear visibility into deletion process
