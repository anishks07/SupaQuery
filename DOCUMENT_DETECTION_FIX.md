# Document Display Issue Fix - October 5, 2025

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Frontend shows "No documents uploaded" despite having documents visible**
- Documents appear in left sidebar
- Chat says "No documents uploaded yet. Please upload a document to get started."

### 2. **Backend Memgraph connection errors**
```
mg_raw_transport_recv: connection closed by server
❌ Error getting stats: failed to receive chunk size
```

---

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Memgraph Connection Timeout
**Cause:** Memgraph was experiencing connection timeouts/closures during stats queries
**Impact:** `get_stats()` returned `{"documents": 0}` even though documents existed in graph
**Result:** GraphRAG service thought no documents were available

### Issue 2: No Fallback Mechanism
**Cause:** When `get_stats()` failed, system immediately returned "No documents" message
**Impact:** User couldn't interact with their uploaded documents
**Result:** Poor user experience despite documents being properly stored

---

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Improved Memgraph Stats Query ✅
**File:** `backend/app/services/memgraph_service.py`

**Changes:**
1. Added **connection retry logic** (3 attempts)
2. Simplified stats query to reduce timeout risk
3. Added connection re-creation on failure
4. Better error handling and logging

**Before:**
```python
def get_stats(self) -> Dict:
    try:
        result = self.db.execute_and_fetch("""...""")
        # Single attempt, no retry
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error: {e}")
        return {"documents": 0, ...}
```

**After:**
```python
def get_stats(self) -> Dict:
    max_retries = 3
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            # Simplified query with OPTIONAL MATCH
            # Connection retry logic
            # Re-create connection on failure
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                print(f"⚠️ Retrying...")
                self.db = Memgraph(...)  # Reconnect
```

### Fix 2: Added Fallback Document Check ✅
**File:** `backend/app/services/graph_rag_v2.py`

**Changes:**
1. When stats show 0 documents, verify with `list_documents()`
2. Trust document existence over failed stats
3. Prevent false "No documents" errors

**Before:**
```python
stats = self.graph.get_stats()
if stats['documents'] == 0:
    return {"answer": "No documents uploaded..."}
```

**After:**
```python
stats = self.graph.get_stats()
if stats['documents'] == 0:
    # Double-check by listing documents
    docs = self.graph.list_documents(limit=1)
    if docs and len(docs) > 0:
        stats['documents'] = len(docs)  # Fix stats
    else:
        return {"answer": "No documents uploaded..."}
```

### Fix 3: Restarted Memgraph ✅
**Action:** `docker restart memgraph`
**Why:** Clear stale connections and reset connection pool

## How It Works Now

### Query Flow with Fixes:
```
1. User sends chat message
   ↓
2. GraphRAG calls get_stats()
   ├─ Attempt 1: Query Memgraph
   ├─ If fails → Attempt 2: Reconnect & retry
   ├─ If fails → Attempt 3: Reconnect & retry
   └─ If all fail → Return 0 docs
   ↓
3. If stats show 0 documents:
   └─ Call list_documents() as verification
      ├─ If documents found → Continue with query
      └─ If truly empty → Show "No documents" message
   ↓
4. Process query with available documents
```

---

## Testing Your Fix

### Test 1: Check if documents are detected
```bash
# In backend terminal, look for:
✅ Stats query successful
# OR
⚠️ Stats showed 0 docs, but found X via list_documents
```

### Test 2: Send a greeting
1. Type "hi" in chat
2. Should see: "Hello! I'm your document analysis assistant. You have X document(s) uploaded..."
3. NOT: "No documents uploaded yet..."

### Test 3: Ask about documents
```
Message: "summarize the document"
Expected: AI response with summary
NOT: "No documents uploaded yet..."
```

### Test 4: Check Memgraph health
```bash
docker logs memgraph --tail 20
# Should see normal operation, not connection errors
```

---

## If Issues Persist

### Option 1: Check Memgraph Status
```bash
# Check if running
docker ps | grep memgraph

# Restart if needed
docker restart memgraph

# Check logs
docker logs memgraph --tail 50
```

### Option 2: Verify Documents in Graph
```bash
# Connect to Memgraph console
docker exec -it memgraph mgconsole

# Run query
MATCH (d:Document) RETURN count(d) as document_count;

# Should show > 0 if documents exist
```

### Option 3: Re-index Documents
```bash
cd backend
python reindex_documents.py
```

### Option 4: Check Backend Logs
Look for these messages:
- ✅ `Stats query successful` - Good!
- ⚠️ `Stats showed 0 docs, but found X via list_documents` - Fallback working!
- ❌ `Error getting stats after 3 attempts` - Connection issue persists

---

## Prevention for Future

### Best Practices:
1. **Monitor Memgraph health** - Check logs periodically
2. **Restart Memgraph weekly** - Prevents connection pool exhaustion
3. **Use connection pooling** - Already implemented, but keep updated
4. **Add health check endpoint** - Monitor stats availability

### Recommended Monitoring:
```bash
# Add to cron or monitoring tool
*/5 * * * * docker logs memgraph --tail 10 | grep -i error
```
