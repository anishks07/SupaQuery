# Query Timeout Fix - October 5, 2025

## Problem Identified

### Error When Summarizing Documents:
```
💬 Chat request from user: Anish
   Message: summarize the document
🔍 Processing query: summarize the document...
� Query type: summary
� Query strategy: retrieve
❌ Error in query: timed out
```

---

## Root Cause

**Memgraph query timeouts** when retrieving document chunks. This happens when:
1. Large knowledge graphs take too long to traverse
2. Connection pool gets exhausted
3. Queries don't have proper timeout limits
4. No retry logic on timeout failures

---

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Added Query Timeout Protection ✅
**File:** `backend/app/services/memgraph_service.py`

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Added `query_timeout = 30s` configuration
2. ✅ Added retry logic (2 attempts) with automatic limit reduction
3. ✅ Simplified query with better performance (`WITH` clause)
4. ✅ Auto-reconnect on timeout failures
5. ✅ Set database-level query timeout

**Before:**
```python
result = self.db.execute_and_fetch("""
    MATCH (d:Document)-[:CONTAINS]->(c:Chunk)
    RETURN ...
    LIMIT $limit
""")
# No timeout handling, no retry
```

**After:**
```python
max_retries = 2
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        # Optimized query with WITH clause
        result = self.db.execute_and_fetch("""
            MATCH (d:Document)-[:CONTAINS]->(c:Chunk)
            WITH c, d
            LIMIT $limit
            RETURN ...
        """)
    except timeout:
        limit = limit // 2  # Reduce load
        reconnect()         # Fresh connection
```

### Fix 2: Better Error Messages for Users ✅
**File:** `backend/app/services/graph_rag_v2.py`

**Changes:**
1. ✅ User-friendly timeout messages
2. ✅ Connection error guidance
3. ✅ Helpful suggestions on timeout

**Before:**
```python
except Exception as e:
    return {"answer": f"Error: {str(e)}"}
```

**After:**
```python
except Exception as e:
    if 'timeout' in str(e).lower():
        return {
            "answer": "⏱️ The query took too long. Try:\n"
                     "• Being more specific\n"
                     "• Asking about a particular document\n"
                     "• Simplifying your query"
        }
```

### Fix 3: Query Optimization ✅

**Added `WITH` clause** before final `RETURN`:
```cypher
MATCH (d:Document)-[:CONTAINS]->(c:Chunk)
WITH c, d          # ← Pipeline optimization
LIMIT $limit       # ← Limit early in pipeline
RETURN c.text, d.filename
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Reduces memory usage
- ✅ Limits results earlier in query pipeline
- ✅ Prevents large intermediate result sets
- ✅ Faster query execution

## How It Works Now

### Query Flow with Timeout Protection:
```
User asks "summarize document"
    ↓
GraphRAG: query_similar_chunks()
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Attempt 1: Query Memgraph   │
│ Timeout: 30s                 │
│ Limit: 5 chunks              │
└─────────────────────────────┘
    ↓
Timeout?
    ↓ YES
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Attempt 2: Retry             │
│ - Reduce limit to 2 chunks   │
│ - Reconnect to Memgraph      │
│ - Simplified query           │
└─────────────────────────────┘
    ↓
Success? → Generate summary
Timeout? → Friendly error message
```

---

## Testing Your Fix

### Step 1: Restart Backend
```bash
# Stop the backend (Ctrl+C in Python terminal)
# Then restart:
cd backend
python main.py
```

### Step 2: Wait for Initialization
Look for these messages:
```
✅ Memgraph Service initialized
   ✓ Connection verified
   ✓ Query timeout set to 30s
✅ GraphRAG initialized
```

### Step 3: Test Greeting (Already Working)
```
Message: "hi"
Expected: "Hello! I'm your document analysis assistant. You have 1 document(s)..."
Status: ✅ WORKING
```

### Step 4: Test Document Summary (The Fix)
```
Message: "summarize the document"
Expected: 
  - Should return a summary within 30 seconds
  - If timeout, shows friendly retry message
  - No crashes or generic errors

Should NOT see:
  - "❌ Error in query: timed out"
  - Generic error messages without guidance
```

### Step 5: Monitor Backend Logs
**Good logs:**
```
🔍 Processing query: summarize the document...
� Query type: summary
� Query strategy: retrieve
   ✓ Retrieved 5 chunks
INFO: 200 OK
```

**Acceptable (Retry working):**
```
🔍 Processing query: summarize the document...
   ⚠️ Query timeout, retrying with smaller limit...
   ✓ Retrieved 2 chunks
INFO: 200 OK
```

**Still has issues:**
```
🔍 Processing query: summarize the document...
   ❌ Query timed out after 2 attempts
⏱️ The query took too long to process...
INFO: 200 OK  (User gets friendly error)
```

## If Timeout Persists

### Option 1: Increase Timeout
**Edit:** `backend/app/services/memgraph_service.py`
```python
self.query_timeout = 60  # Increase from 30 to 60 seconds
```

### Option 2: Reduce Initial Chunk Limit
**When calling query:**
```python
chunks = self.graph.query_similar_chunks(query, limit=3)  # Reduced from 5
```

### Option 3: Check Memgraph Performance
```bash
# Check Memgraph resource usage
docker stats memgraph

# Should see reasonable CPU/Memory (not maxed out)
# If maxed out, restart Memgraph:
docker restart memgraph
```

### Option 4: Optimize Graph Structure
```bash
# Check graph size
docker exec -it memgraph mgconsole

# Run in console:
MATCH (n) RETURN labels(n) as type, count(n) as count;
MATCH ()-[r]->() RETURN type(r) as rel_type, count(r) as count;

# If too many relationships, consider:
# - Limiting entity extraction
# - Reducing chunk size
# - Archiving old documents
```

### Option 5: Clear and Rebuild Graph (Last Resort)
```bash
# WARNING: This deletes all graph data
cd backend
python cleanup_orphaned_entities.py

# Re-upload documents to rebuild graph
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily Checks:
```bash
# Check Memgraph health
docker logs memgraph --tail 50 | grep -i error

# Check backend for timeout patterns
# In backend terminal, look for:
#   ⚠️ Query timeout
#   ❌ Query timed out after 2 attempts
```

### Weekly Maintenance:
```bash
# Restart Memgraph to clear connection pools
docker restart memgraph

# Check graph statistics
docker exec -it memgraph mgconsole
> MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);
```

### Monthly Cleanup:
```bash
# Remove orphaned entities
cd backend
python cleanup_orphaned_entities.py
```

---

**Status:** ✅ **READY TO TEST** - Restart backend and try "summarize the document"

1. Restart backend: `python main.py`
2. Wait for "✅ GraphRAG initialized"
3. Test greeting: "hi" (already working)
4. Test summary: "summarize the document" (the fix)
