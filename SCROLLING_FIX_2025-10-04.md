# Scrolling Container Fix - October 4, 2025

## Problem
The document upload area and chatbot were expanding the page height instead of having fixed containers with internal scrolling. When new files were uploaded or messages were sent, the webpage would grow longer, requiring users to scroll the entire page.

## Solution
Implemented proper height constraints and overflow management to create fixed-height containers with internal scrolling.

## Changes Made

### File: `/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`

#### 1. Left Panel (Document Upload Area)
- **Added `h-screen`** to the main panel container to fix its height to viewport
- **Added `flex-shrink-0`** to the header section to prevent it from shrinking
- **Wrapped ScrollArea in a flex container** with `flex-1 overflow-hidden` to properly contain the scrollable content
- This ensures the document list scrolls within its container instead of expanding the page

#### 2. Right Panel (Chat Interface)
- **Added `h-screen`** to the main chat container to fix its height to viewport
- **Added `flex-shrink-0`** to both the header and input area to keep them fixed
- **Wrapped ScrollArea in a flex container** with `flex-1 overflow-hidden` for the messages area
- This ensures chat messages scroll within their container instead of expanding the page

## Result
- ✅ Document upload area now has a fixed height with internal scrolling
- ✅ Chat interface now has a fixed height with internal scrolling
- ✅ Page maintains consistent viewport height regardless of content
- ✅ Better user experience on all screen sizes
- ✅ Mobile responsive behavior maintained

## Technical Details

### Before:
```tsx
<ScrollArea className="flex-1 p-3 md:p-4">
  <div className="space-y-2 md:space-y-3">
    {/* Content */}
  </div>
</ScrollArea>
```

### After:
```tsx
<div className="flex-1 overflow-hidden">
  <ScrollArea className="h-full p-3 md:p-4">
    <div className="space-y-2 md:space-y-3">
      {/* Content */}
    </div>
  </ScrollArea>
</div>
```

The key change is wrapping the `ScrollArea` with a container that has:
- `flex-1`: Takes up available space
- `overflow-hidden`: Prevents content from spilling out
- `h-full` on ScrollArea: Makes it fill the parent container

This creates a proper scrolling viewport within a fixed-height container.
