# 📚 Document Awareness Feature (Chat Greeting)

## ⚠️ NOTE: This document describes showing documents in CHAT GREETINGS

**For the Data Ingestion panel fix, see `DOCUMENT_LIST_UI_FIX.md`**

---

## Problem Identified (Chat Greeting Context)

**Original Implementation**: When users said "hi", they got a friendly greeting but had no idea what documents were in the system.

This affected the chat experience:
- ❌ Users got generic greeting
- ❌ No context about available documents
- ❌ Didn't know what they could ask about
- ❌ Had to manually check elsewhere

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Feature: **Document List in Chat Greeting**

When users say "hi" or "hello", they now see:
1. ✅ Number of documents uploaded
2. ✅ **List of actual document filenames**
3. ✅ Entity count
4. ✅ Suggestions for questions

---

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before Fix:
```
User: "hi"
AI: "Hello! I'm SupaQuery...
     You have 2 documents uploaded with 302 entities extracted.
     
     Try asking:
     - What is this document about?
     - Who are mentioned?"
```
**Problem**: User has NO IDEA which documents are uploaded!

### After Fix:
```
User: "hi"  
AI: "Hello! I'm SupaQuery...
     You have 2 documents uploaded with 302 entities extracted.
     
     📚 Your uploaded documents:
     1. 📄 2404.08865v1.pdf
     
     *Ask me anything about these documents!*
     
     Try asking:
     - What is this document about?
     - Who are mentioned?"
```
**Solution**: User immediately sees WHAT documents they have! ✅

---

## 🎯 Features Added

### 1. **Document List Method**
Added to `MemgraphService`:
```python
def list_documents(self, limit: int = 20) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    List all documents in the graph
    Returns: List with id, filename, type, created_at, chunk_count
    """
```

**Query**:
```cypher
MATCH (d:Document)
OPTIONAL MATCH (d)-[:CONTAINS]->(c:Chunk)
WITH d, count(c) as chunk_count
RETURN d.id, d.filename, d.type, d.created_at, chunk_count
ORDER BY d.created_at DESC
LIMIT $limit
```

### 2. **Duplicate Removal**
```python
# Remove duplicates by filename
seen_filenames = set()
unique_docs = []
for doc in doc_list:
    if filename not in seen_filenames:
        seen_filenames.add(filename)
        unique_docs.append(doc)
```

**Why**: Users may upload same file multiple times, we show each unique file once.

### 3. **Filename Truncation**
```python
# Truncate long filenames for clean display
if len(doc_name) > 50:
    doc_name = doc_name[:47] + "..."
```

**Example**: 
- Original: `very_long_research_paper_about_llm_performance_analysis.pdf`
- Displayed: `very_long_research_paper_about_llm_perfor...`

### 4. **Smart Display**
- Shows max 5 documents in greeting
- If more than 5, shows "...and N more"
- Adds document emoji 📄 for visual clarity
- Adds call-to-action: *"Ask me anything about these documents!"*

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

#### 1. `backend/app/services/memgraph_service.py`
**Added**: `list_documents()` method (33 lines)

**Location**: Before `get_stats()` method

**Returns**:
```python
[
    {
        "id": "doc-uuid-1",
        "filename": "research.pdf",
        "type": "pdf",
        "created_at": "2025-10-04T12:30:00",
        "chunk_count": 20
    },
    ...
]
```

#### 2. `backend/app/services/graph_rag.py`
**Modified**: Greeting response generation (~30 lines)

**Logic**:
1. Check if documents exist
2. Fetch document list from Memgraph
3. Remove duplicates by filename
4. Truncate long names
5. Format as numbered list with emojis
6. Add to greeting response
