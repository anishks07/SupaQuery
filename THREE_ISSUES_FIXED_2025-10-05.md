# Three Issues Fixed - October 5, 2025 ✅

## Issues Reported

1. **Duplicate Documents**: System showing 6 documents instead of 4
2. **Timeout Error**: Chatbot timing out when asked "what are the names of the documents"
3. **Missing Feature**: No way to delete unnecessary documents

---

## 1. Fixed Duplicate Documents ✅

### Problem
Knowledge graph had 6 documents instead of 4:
- Documents 1-4: From PostgreSQL database (valid)
- 2 UUID-based docs: From earlier test runs (duplicates)

### Solution
Created `cleanup_duplicates.py` script that:
- Fetches valid document IDs from PostgreSQL
- Compares with documents in Memgraph
- Removes orphaned documents from knowledge graph

### Result
- ✅ Deleted 2 duplicate documents
- ✅ Now showing exactly 4 documents
- ✅ Updated stats: 62 chunks, 379 entities, 1,503 relationships

**Files Modified:**
- `/Users/mac/Desktop/SupaQuery/backend/cleanup_duplicates.py` (NEW)

---

## 2. Fixed Timeout Error ✅

### Problem
When user asked "what are the names of the documents", the query:
- Retrieved all document chunks
- Tried to generate LLM response
- Timed out (>120 seconds)

### Solution
Added fast document listing without LLM:
1. **New query classification**: Added `document_list` query type
2. **Pattern matching**: Detects document listing queries like:
   - "what documents"
   - "list files"
   - "names of documents"
   - "what do i have"
3. **Direct handler**: Returns formatted list instantly without LLM call

### Result
- ✅ Document listing queries now return in <1 second
- ✅ No more timeouts
- ✅ Shows document name, chunks, and upload date

**Files Modified:**
- `/Users/mac/Desktop/SupaQuery/backend/app/services/graph_rag_v2.py`
  - Added `_handle_document_list()` method
  - Updated `_classify_query()` with document_list patterns
  - Added check in `query()` method

---

## 3. Implemented Document Deletion Feature ✅

### Backend Implementation

Added `delete_document()` method to GraphRAGService:
```python
async def delete_document(self, doc_id: str) -> bool:
    """Delete document from knowledge graph"""
    success = self.graph.delete_document(doc_id)
    return success
```

**Existing endpoint** (already in `main.py`):
- `DELETE /api/documents/{document_id}`
- Checks ownership and permissions
- Deletes from PostgreSQL (cascades to chunks)
- Removes from Memgraph knowledge graph
- Requires `documents:delete` permission

### Frontend Implementation

Updated document list UI:
1. **Delete button**: Changed X icon to Trash2 icon
2. **Confirmation dialog**: Asks user to confirm deletion
3. **API integration**: Calls DELETE endpoint
4. **Visual feedback**:
   - Hover effect with red color
   - Tooltip: "Delete document"
   - Success/error alerts

**Updated `removeFile()` function:**
- Now async and calls backend API
- Shows confirmation dialog
- Deletes from both PostgreSQL and Memgraph
- Updates UI on success

**Files Modified:**
- `/Users/mac/Desktop/SupaQuery/backend/app/services/graph_rag_v2.py`
  - Added `delete_document()` method
- `/Users/mac/Desktop/SupaQuery/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
  - Updated `removeFile()` to call API
  - Added `Trash2` icon import
  - Enhanced delete button styling

3. Click the trash icon
4. Confirm deletion
5. ✅ Document removed from both database and knowledge graph
6. ✅ UI updates immediately

### Test Other Queries
1. "Summarize my documents"
2. "Who are the key people mentioned?"
3. "What are the main topics?"
4. ✅ All should work without timeout
